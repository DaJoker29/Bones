Bones
=====

Barebones Skeleton of a basic web design or dev project using all of my favorite tools (Bootstrap, Less, jQuery, Grunt, Jade, Bower and others)


Usage
=====
Until I make a Yeoman Generator for this (which I plan to do shortly), usage is pretty nasty but straight-forward

1. `git clone` repo
2. run `npm install` to setup dependencies
3. run `bower install` for packages
4. `Grunt` starts automation server
5. Enjoy
